> Commits you push to the connected branch sync back to Lovable and show up in

## Architecture
- Use dedicated TanStack routes for Home, About, Services, AI Fields, Work, Certificates, and Contact so each major portfolio area has a shareable URL and unique metadata.
- Keep shared navigation, background, footer, scroll controls, and contact actions in the root layout so they remain consistent across all pages.
